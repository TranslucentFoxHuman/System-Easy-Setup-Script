# System-Easy-Setup-Script

<small>This text is translated from Japanese to English using the built-in translation function of Firefox. And, some of them are rough English translations by Japanese people who do not use English natively. There may be a mistranslation, but please read on hard :)</small>

This script is a script that automatically performs the initial setting for comfortable use of various operating systems in bulk.   
You can do all the tedious tasks, such as installing the required software, removing unnecessary components, and rewriting system settings.
  
The software was originally created by the developer TlFoxHuman for himself. It may not be suitable for general use, but you can customize what you do and do not do by selecting it at runtime. Unnecessary manipulations to you do not need to perform.
  
The operating system which the script is currently being created is as follows:
- Windows 11 (mainly Tiny11)

The Debian/Ubuntu script is also in my hands, but this is not published because I donâ€™t think it will be useful to anyone other than me. Because GNU/Linux is easy to use from almost the beginning, right?
